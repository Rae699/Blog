## Week 1 ‚Äî From Zero to CS  

Not long ago, I was a **real estate lawyer**. Safe, predictable, linear.  
Then crypto happened. Then trading. And now... this.  

I'm starting from scratch. (Again.)  

Sure, I've been trading crypto for years, but when it comes to real computer science? I'm a total beginner.  

Coding? More like **vibe-coding with AI**.  
Python? Barely holding on without assistance.  

And yet‚Ä¶ over the last 2 months, I've pushed over **27,800 lines of code** across my trading systems.  
But let's be honest‚Äîanyone can stack lines of code with an AI copilot. The real challenge now is transforming that raw output into true **critical thinking**, **architecture**, and **system design**.  

Because I don't just want to build things that work.  
I want to understand why they work, how they scale, and what breaks them.  
I'm done being "technical enough" to scrape by.  

And the only way is through.

## How It Started  

It all began with my first trading system automation.  

In December 2024, I cobbled together a 2,500-line, AI-fueled monster of scripts.  
It was messy. But it worked.  
I built my first **screeners** to automate my trading strategies, and when those signals started firing‚Ä¶ man, it felt like magic.  

But the high didn't last long.  

I realized immediately:  
- This was duct tape.  
- This wasn't scalable.  
- I didn't actually understand the code beneath the surface.  

If I wanted to build something real‚Äîplug in new strategies, add exchange integrations, build robust pipelines, and eventually merge it with **Sentinelle**, my collaborative project with Jun, Sylvain, and Emile‚ÄîI needed to go back to the foundations.  

I needed Computer Science.

## What I(-AI) have Achieved (So Far)

It's been about **two months**. Here's what that looks like:

- ‚úÖ **27,887 lines of code written**  
- ‚úÖ **401 hours of tracked work**  
- ‚úÖ First working version of my trading system live  
- ‚úÖ Automating real strategies end-to-end  

But enough talk.  

Here's a quick walkthrough of the system running:

### üìä Proof of Work

But...
This is more than just writing code.  
I'm dedicating significant hours, tackling real-world challenges, and meticulously tracking every moment of my journey.
How?
By leveraging AI, iterating through numerous trials and errors until success is achieved.

While I may not fully grasp the intricate workings beneath the surface yet, I am committed to continuous learning and improvement.
AI provides guidance, but I am determined to enhance my own critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

The journey has just begun, and my potential is limitless.

## Where I (really) Am  

Without AI copilot, right now?  
- Learning Python basics through **Exercism**.  
- Very low critical thinking.
- Struggling (in the best way).  
- Catching my own mistakes instead of just pasting AI fixes.  
- Slowly getting comfortable with problems that once felt impossible.  

I'm not here to fake expertise. I'm here to document the real thing: the messy, slow climb from beginner to pro-builder.  


---

## Where I'm Going  

I'm taking a **"classics first"** approach, knowing it might take years‚Äîbut also knowing these are the foundations that last:  

- **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)**  
- **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective (CS:APP)**  
- **The Algorithm Design Manual**  
- **Designing Data-Intensive Applications**  
- **Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach**  
- **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces**  
- **C Programming: A Modern Approach**  
- **Fluent Python**  

And after that? More **LeetCode**, more AI, and my own projects to lock it all in.  

For AI? Starting with Andrew Ng's courses, then leveling up with:

## My Ultimate Goal: AI-Powered Trading  

Beyond mastering the CS fundamentals, my ultimate objectives are:
1. Achieving excellence as a software engineer with profound expertise.
2. Developing a fully automated trading system driven by advanced AI.

Not just scripts.  
A full-scale, adaptive system that can:  

- Execute strategies with precision  
- Optimize with Machine Learning  
- Adapt with Reinforcement Learning  
- Identify patterns with Deep Learning  


---

## Why I Believe I Can Do This

I've been fortunate to excel in every field I've pursued:
- As a lawyer, I was recognized for my analytical skills and attention to detail
- In trading, I've consistently outperformed by combining technical analysis with systematic approaches
- Now, I'm bringing that same drive for excellence to software engineering

The pattern is clear: I don't just participate in fields‚ÄîI aim at mastering them. 
And software engineering is no exception.


---

## The reading list for that:  
1. **Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach** (Russell & Norvig)  
2. **Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning** (Bishop)  
3. **Deep Learning** (Goodfellow, Bengio & Courville)  

And hands-on practice through:  
- **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow** (G√©ron)  
- **Deep Learning with Python** (Chollet)  
- **Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai & PyTorch** (Howard & Gugger)  

The goal is simple:  
Take my current strategies and unlock their next level using AI to manage risk, detect market regimes, and optimize execution.

## Now Working On  

- [Dots](https://github.com/Rae699/Dots) ‚Äî signal screeners, trading tools (some parts private).  
  ‚Üí Current goal: finalize 5 screeners, trace and refactor the code, remove redundancies, and optimize after reinforcing my DSA skills.  

- [Sentinelle](https://github.com/SentiCap/SentinelleCap) ‚Äî a collaborative trading infrastructure with Jun, Sylvain, and Emile (ex-investment bankers).

## How I'm Getting There  

- **8 hours every day**, no exceptions.  
- Exercism, LeetCode, reading and doing the exercises of my books, coding, repeat.  
- Tracking everything. Wins, failures, breakthroughs.  
- Staying patient.  

This isn't a bootcamp.  
This is the new normal.

This blog is how I'll stay accountable.  

And maybe one day, I'll look back at this first post and barely recognize the person who wrote it.  

For now, I'm just getting started.
