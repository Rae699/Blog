# Week 7 - Bilan

Another checkpoint on the road. Let's see where we stand.

## Achievements:

### ✅ Python - Exercism Progress
Currently 40 exercises / 140  
After spending the first few weeks building deep foundations, I'm finally picking up the pace. Exercises that used to take me an hour now take 15–20 minutes without losing any quality of understanding.

I'm still deliberately focusing on clean, idiomatic code:
- Consistent use of comprehensions, generators, unpacking
- Clear variable naming and modular thinking
- Testing edge cases, thinking about exceptions, immutability
=> I am adding unit tests under my code (instead of a separate module) in order to expose myself to testing.

The most important thing is that Python *feels* way more natural now. It’s still a little bit of "How do I write this?" but more and molre of it’s "What’s the best way to design this?"
=> The goal remains the same but things are going to slow down based on my heavy courseload for OMSCS.

### 🥋 Python - Codewars Progress

I'm still focusing on mid-level katas (8, 7, 6 kyu) to consolidate my core skills.  
Rather than rushing towards 4 kyu and above, I'm building **muscle memory** for:
- Problem decomposition
- Pattern recognition
- Efficient iteration over data structures
- Thinking about time/space tradeoffs even in simple problems

Currently, i have solved:
- 8 kyu: 50
- 7 kyu: 51
- 6 kyu: 13
Total: 124

Each "easy" problem solved well lays the groundwork for solving "hard" problems *quickly and cleanly* in the future.
=> Goal remains the same, a couple of kyus per day to keep unemployment away.

### 🧠 Anki - Reinforcement Progress
My Anki deck for Python is now fully active and reviewed daily.  
Categories I'm reinforcing:
- Python standard library modules
- Common pitfalls and exceptions
- Functional programming patterns
- Object-oriented design best practices

Anki has proven absolutely invaluable.

The retention curve is visible in my coding confidence: things I would have Googled a month ago now come instantly.

### ⌨️ Typing Speed
I’m maintaining an average typing speed of **82-85 WPM**, with peaks over **140 WPM**.  
Accuracy remains stable at **94–95%**, even when pushing for speed.

I'm still struggling a bit with the "S" key placement but it's slowly improving with focused drills. 

All my typing stats can be tracked at [my keybr profile](https://www.keybr.com/profile/s3tv7lr).
=> Currently, a bnit on hold, i will deep dive into it again. I really need to fix that right hand and the 'S' issues despite this one starts feeling more and more natural.

### 📚 SICP and Composing Programs Completion
I've completed Chapter 2 of SICP, which has been a challenging yet rewarding journey. The major takeaways include:
- Prioritizing **Abstract Data Design** over mere representation
- Emphasizing **Efficiency by default** by considering recursion, mutation, and memory management early in the design process
- Upholding **Mental rigor**: Precision is crucial; sloppy thinking leads to errors

While SICP is undeniably dense and theoretical, the mental workout it provides is invaluable. 

In addition to my progress with SICP, I've completed "Composing Programs," a text that I wholeheartedly endorse. This book, grounded in Python, provides a more approachable exploration of the same foundational concepts, serving as a perfect companion to the rigorous challenges of SICP. Its Python-centric approach demystifies complex ideas, making them more digestible and applicable, thereby enhancing my understanding and appreciation of abstract data design and efficient programming practices.
=> Any beginner should start here, and not on SICP.

### 🧮 Mathematics - Full Rebuild
I've completed a full review of:
- Algebra
- Geometry
- Trigonometry
- Precalculus
- Probability basics

Moving towards the last year of high school specialized maths (french curriculum) to be ready!
I'm now moving toward **Discrete Math foundations**—sets, relations, functions, combinatorics, graphs—essential for CS.

This will prepare me for future coursework in Algorithms, Machine Learning, and beyond.

## 🎓 Academic Journey - Official Courses Update
I'm pushing hard because I’m preparing for **Georgia Tech's OMSCS**.

**Concrete steps already taken:**
- 🏛️ Enrolled in official university classes at **Colorado State University Global**:
  - **MATH 350** (Mathematical Reasoning and Proof)
  - **CS 400** (Data Structures and Algorithms (in Java))

- 📜 Completed the **Introduction to Python Programming** Professional Certificate from [The Georgia Institute of Technology on edX](https://www.edx.org/certificates/professional-certificate/the-georgia-institute-of-technology-introduction-to-python-programming).

- ☕ Currently enrolled in **Java Programming** MOOC to meet the Object-Oriented prerequisite for OMSCS admission (15 days to finish, right on time for my first class)

- 📝 **TOEFL passed** with a score just under 100. (Even though I studied in English for years, getting an official proof is a mandatory prerequisite to enter OMSCS.)

This extra academic workload is intense, but it's necessary to build a strong, verifiable profile for Georgia Tech and future opportunities.

I’m not just building skills—I'm building *credentials and momentum*.

## 📻 Dots & Sentinelle Updates
Not much visible movement yet.  
The architecture refactor is mentally underway, but I’m consciously waiting until:
- I've mastered better data structures
- I've internalized performance profiling tools
- I've built stronger systems thinking

Patience now = Excellence later.

A friend of mine has started working on machine learning for the Dots project. I'll provide updates if there are any relevant developments.

## 🎯 Objectives for the Next Month:

1. **Exercism**: Reach 60 exercises+
2. **Codewars**: Achieve 7 kyu objective and start solving 6 kyu.
3. **Math**: Begin CS-specific math topics (discrete math, probability, basic linear algebra).
4. **Colorado Courses**: Maintain top grades.
5. **Typing**: Achieve consistent 90 WPM while improving "S" key performance.
3. **Java MOOC**: Complete and pass to satisfy OMSCS prerequisites.
7. **Anki**: Expand the deck to cover Java and Math.

## 🧠 Mental Health and the Importance of Rest

In the midst of this intense academic and personal growth journey, I've realized the importance of taking care of my mental health. 
The feeling of exhaustion has been creeping in, and it's a clear signal that I need to pause and recharge. 

To maintain the quality of my work and ensure sustainable progress, I'm planning a 3 to 4-day break with absolutely no work. 
This downtime is crucial for resetting my mind, allowing me to return with renewed energy and focus. It's a reminder that rest is not a luxury, but a necessity for long-term success and well-being.

That's the checkpoint for Week 7.  

Still climbing—deeper, sharper, faster.  
No shortcuts. No distractions. Only growth.

See you at the next checkpoint.
