## 🛠️ The Plan: 24 Months to Mastery

Welcome! This repository documents my journey from total beginner to mastering computer science, algorithms, and AI-driven trading systems.  
Over the next **24 months**, I'll be following a structured plan combining classic CS education, daily practice, and real-world projects.

This journey is meticulously planned to ensure a structured and comprehensive path to mastery. 
It's a personal roadmap designed to keep me organized and focused on my goals.

*“This 24-month plan is designed to not only master core CS and AI but to meet the bar of systems design and algorithmic excellence required to operate at the scale of companies like Google.”*

## 📚 Core CS Curriculum
- **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)**: Partial reading as it is a bit of a "special" book. Focuses on programming paradigms, recursion, and functional programming.
- **Composing Programs (John DeNero)**: Comprehensive reading. This book serves as an accessible follow-up to SICP, offering a Python-based approach to understanding programming paradigms, recursion, and functional programming.
- **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective (CS:APP)**: Delves into low-level programming, memory, assembly, and linking.
- **The Algorithm Design Manual (Skiena)**: Concentrates on algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.
- **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)**: Covers memory, scheduling, concurrency, processes, and virtual memory.
- **Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach**: Discusses TCP/IP, HTTP, routing, security, and distributed networking.
- **Thinking in Systems (Meadows)**: Provides insights into big-picture system design and architecture.
- **Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDIA)**: Explores distributed data, scalability, and real-time computing.
- **Reading in Database**: Focuses on database internals, including indexes, transactions, and query optimization.
- **Efficient Python**: 1 lesson per day, for 90 days. 
- **C Programming: A Modern Approach**: Emphasizes low-level memory management, pointers, and system programming.
- **Cloud Architecture Patterns**: Examines distributed AI applications and scalable systems.
-	**Introduction to the Theory of Computation**: Only Ch. 1-6, light Ch. 7-9: Covers automata & complexity for deeper CS knowledge.
-	**Computational Complexity**: Only Part I & II.


## 🐍 Python Proficiency Track
A structured path to master Python programming fundamentals and advanced concepts:

### 1. Foundation Courses
- [Python Essentials 1](https://pythoninstitute.org/python-essentials-1): Core Python fundamentals
- [Python Essentials 2](https://pythoninstitute.org/python-essentials-2): Advanced Python concepts

### 2. Daily Practice Structure
- **Exercism**: 
  - 2 exercises per day until medium difficulty (Excercise ~90/140)
  - 1 exercise per day after reaching medium
  - Focus on understanding patterns and best practices

### 3. Codewars Progression Path
1. **Initial Foundation (100 katas)**
   - Start at [Codewars Dashboard](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard)
   - Focus on Fundamentals category
   - Target: 100 katas per level to progress from 8 to 5 kyu
   - Note: Most exercises will be 8/7/6 kyu level

2. **Structured Collection Training**
   - [Python 7 kyu Collection](https://www.codewars.com/collections/python-7kyu): 100 katas
   - [Python 6 kyu Collection](https://www.codewars.com/collections/python-6kyu-1): 100 katas
   - [Python 5 kyu Collection](https://www.codewars.com/collections/python-5kyu): 100 katas
   - Track progress at: [Your Codewars Profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/YourProfileName)

### 4. LeetCode Integration
- Begin LeetCode practice when reaching 5 kyu on Codewars
- This ensures solid foundation before tackling more complex algorithmic challenges

## 🤖 AI Track (For Advanced Trading Systems)
Once the core systems are solid:
- **Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Russell & Norvig)**
- **Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Bishop)**
- **Deep Learning (Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville)**
- **+ One of these for hands-on practice:**
  - Hands-On Machine Learning (Géron)
  - Deep Learning with Python (Chollet)
  - Deep Learning for Coders (Howard & Gugger)

## 🏗️ Daily Routine (The Dots Discipline)
Every day, without compromise, i will mix some of these to grind hard:
- ⌨️ **Typing Practice** — 15 min (Goal: >120 WPM)
- 🐍 **Exercism/Codewars (Python)** — 90 min (Goal: 5+ exercises per week until lessons are completed, then 2+ exercises per day for a total of ~10 per week. Should take 4 months ~ish). Followed by reading Efficient Python (one item per day for 90 days.  Should take 4 months ~ish), and High Performance Python (±10 pages per day. Should take ~2.5 months). Expected total: ~11 months.  
- 🧠 **LeetCode, NeetCode** — algorithmic drills
- 🛠️ **The Missing Semester** — Complete 1 lesson per day. Once finished, allocate the freed-up time to additional Exercism/Python reading/LeetCode practice.
- 📖 **CS Readings** — 300 min (from the curriculum above)
- 📊 **Dots Trading System** — ongoing development & refactoring

The mission: **become the Cyborg**, where human intuition and AI co-evolve through disciplined systems thinking, coding fluency, and algorithmic sharpness.

## 🧠 Knowledge Retention Strategy: Anki System

To ensure long-term retention of concepts and prevent knowledge decay, I've implemented a comprehensive Anki-based spaced repetition system:

### Core Principles
- **Daily Review**: 30 minutes dedicated to Anki reviews every morning
- **Atomic Cards**: Each card contains a single concept (no lists or multi-part answers)
- **Active Recall**: Cards formulated as questions that require synthesis, not mere memorization
- **Code Examples**: Important patterns and idioms captured with minimal working examples 

### Card Structure & Organization
- **Hierarchical Tags**: All cards tagged by subject, sub-topic, and difficulty
- **Card Types**:
  - **Concept Cards**: Core CS principles and theory
  - **Category Cards**: Common design patterns and idioms, systems:
    - **Algorithm Cards**: Implementation details of key algorithms
    - **System Design Cards**: Architecture patterns and trade-offs

### Integration with Learning
- **Review Schedule**: Strictly following Anki's spaced repetition algorithm

This systematic approach ensures that knowledge compounds over time rather than decaying, creating a continuously strengthening mental model of computer science and software engineering principles.

## 🚧 Current Projects


### [Dots](https://github.com/Rae699/Dots)

A modular trading suite for signal generation and strategy automation. From scratch.

**In progress:**
- Finalize 5 core screeners.
- Debug with VizTracer/Profiler to unlock bottlenecks
- Refactor the whole codebase
- Add machine learning using my structured/unstructred from my years of trading journal
- Full code optimization using new DSA knowledge.


### [Sentinelle](https://github.com/SentiCap/SentinelleCap)

A collaborative trading infrastructure with modular, plug-and-play strategies.


---

## 🎯 Meta Goals

- ✅ Build open-source projects (for the portfolio and community).
- ✅ Write blog posts and developer logs.
- ✅ Share progress openly (accountability + proof of work).
- ✅ Commit to 8-hour deep work days.
- ✅ Track wins, blockers, breakthroughs.


---

## 📌 Why This Exists

### To become the kind of engineer Google hires:
A systems-minded, algorithmically sharp, AI-enabled builder who can design, optimize, and deploy robust, high-performance infrastructure.

### To close the gap between:
- **"I can hack it together."**  
and  
- **"I can build it properly."**

And to document the entire journey from beginner to builder to architect.  

Follow along, fork the repo, or reach out. 

Let's build.
