# My Journey Through SICP  

## Chapter I — First Contact with SICP  

First feelings? Pure fire.  

SICP is exactly what I was looking for without even knowing it existed—the missing piece to start programming from the core, from first principles, with no shortcuts and no assumptions.  
I'm not here to "fix" my understanding. There's nothing to fix. My brain never got wired in the first place. I'm here to wire it right from the beginning.  

And it's crazy how fast the perspective shifts. Just 40 pages in, and already I can feel the difference.  
Concepts that felt abstract before are now concrete, step-by-step mechanics. Take the **substitution model**—it's not theory anymore. Now I can see exactly how a computer walks through an expression, reducing it piece by piece, just like an interpreter would.  

Then come the two evaluation strategies that define how expressions unfold:  
- **Applicative-order**: evaluate all the arguments first, then apply the function.  
- **Normal-order**: delay evaluation until the last possible moment.  

It sounds simple, but it's a fundamental shift in how you think about computation.  
Most interpreters stick with applicative-order. And it works—until it doesn't. 
When values can't resolve cleanly, or expressions get too deep, that default approach can leave you stuck. 

Already I can see why understanding these patterns matters if you want to build systems that hold up under pressure.  

And recursion…  
I finally get recursion. Not just how to write a recursive function, but what's really happening underneath.  
The difference between:  
- A **recursive process** stacking up deferred operations, eating memory and time as it grows.  
- An **iterative process** looping smoothly, using constant space no matter how many cycles it runs.  

Before, recursion always felt like a trick—powerful but dangerous. Now it feels like a tool I actually understand.  

And then comes the **Ackermann function**.  
A perfect demonstration of how recursion can explode if you're not careful. Tiny inputs leading to massive computation. It's humbling, and it shows exactly why these ideas aren't just academic. Left unchecked, something like that can push any system over the edge.

## What's Next  

This is just the start.  
I didn't come to SICP looking for shortcuts. I'm here to build the right foundation from scratch. To wire my thinking the right way from day one, with the core mental models that will scale wherever I take them next.  

This isn't about getting better at coding.  
It's about learning how to think in computation.  

More to come.
