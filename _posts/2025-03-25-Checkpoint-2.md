# Week 5 - Bilan

Time for the second checkpoint. Let's see where we stand.

## Achievements:

### ‚úÖ Python - Exercism Progress
Currently 20 exercises / 140
While the raw numbers might not look impressive, I've been spending a couple of hours daily to truly internalize the syntax of the 17 lessons completed so far. 
This deeper approach is paying dividends‚ÄîI'm feeling significantly more confident when writing code now.

Rather than rushing through exercises and forgetting half of what I learned, I've been meticulously reviewing each solution, understanding the Python idioms, and making sure the syntax becomes second nature. It's slow progress in terms of exercise count, but the quality of understanding has increased dramatically.

### ü•ã Python - Codewars Progress

While I've reached 5 kyu on Codewars, I'm taking a strategic approach to my learning. Rather than chasing higher kyu levels, I'm focusing on mastering fundamentals through volume. I'm deliberately working through chains of 8, 7, and 6 kyu problems to:
- Build muscle memory for Python syntax
- Develop intuitive problem-solving patterns
- Strengthen my foundation before tackling more complex challenges

This approach means my kyu level doesn't fully reflect my problem-solving capabilities, but I'm more interested in deep understanding than quick advancement. Each solved kata, regardless of its level, adds another layer to my programming intuition.

### üß† Anki

I've started using Anki to reinforce my Python learning and improve retention. This spaced repetition approach is already showing promising results. I'm creating flashcards for:

- Python syntax and built-in functions
- Common programming patterns
- Standard library modules and their key features
- Best practices and idioms

Here's a snapshot of my current Python learning deck:

The systematic review process helps ensure that concepts move from short-term to long-term memory, making coding more fluid and natural. 
What makes Anki particularly effective is its implementation of scientifically-proven spaced repetition algorithms:

- **Optimized Review Intervals**: The software automatically adjusts review schedules based on how well I recall each concept. Easy cards appear less frequently, while challenging ones surface more often.
- **Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve**: Anki's algorithm is based on Hermann Ebbinghaus's research on memory retention, scheduling reviews just before I'm likely to forget a concept.
- **Active Recall**: Rather than passive reading, Anki forces active engagement with the material, strengthening neural pathways and improving long-term retention.
- **Metacognitive Feedback**: After each card, I rate my recall difficulty, which helps the algorithm optimize future review timing.

This scientific approach to learning means I'm not just memorizing Python concepts‚ÄîI'm integrating them into my long-term memory in a way that makes them readily accessible during coding sessions. The efficiency of spaced repetition means I spend less time reviewing while achieving better retention rates.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Typing Speed

Great progress here! I'm consistently hitting over 80 words per minute and unlocking letters step by step. The "S" key has been giving me trouble‚Äîmy left hand on the home row seems to have difficulty positioning the right finger precisely over the S key.

Here are some highlights from my typing journey:

![All Time Statistics]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/key_all_time_statistics1.png)

As you can see, I've completed 710 lessons with an average speed of 82.8 WPM and a top speed of 113.8 WPM. My accuracy is consistently high at 94.5%.

I'm particularly proud of my accuracy streaks:

The performance distribution is also interesting - my typing speed puts me in the top 10% of users:

I've been tracking my progress for individual keys as well:

The learning progress overview shows how consistent I've been with practicing regularly:

My top speed evolution shows significant improvement over time, peaking at 142.2 WPM:

### üìö SICP Deep Dive

Check my other posts for the full details, but I've finished Chapter 1 and I'm well into Chapter 2 now. 
The mental shift has been profound‚ÄîI've stopped thinking about programming in terms of "how to write that" and started thinking in terms of "how to build that efficiently."

I'm now considering how to:
- Optimize data types and structures
- Think about edge cases for recursion
- Integrate memory considerations and Big O thinking into my solutions

The frameworks provided by SICP are reshaping my entire approach to problem-solving in programming.

Honest truth? There is way too much verbose for my linking, SICP is slowing down my momentum as i dont really enjoy my time reading it.
But it is fine, i am going over my feelings and keep moving forward

### üßÆ Big Push in Mathematics

I've taken another deep dive into mathematics, covering everything from secondary school material up through the advanced high school math specialty curriculum. 
I'm making strong progress and will continue for another month or two to ensure everything is well integrated up to the very end of high-school maths.

Thanks to my previous work on CFA Level 1 and parts of Level 2 (covering quantitative methods, economics, and ethics‚Äî3 out of 10 chapters), I'm actually quite comfortable with probability theory already.

### üñ•Ô∏è Missing Semester

Slow but steady progress here. 
I'm definitely more comfortable with the shell, but need to fully internalize the concepts and commands. 
This is an area where repeated practice is essential.

## üìª Dots & Sentinelle Updates

I'm beginning to think about how to refactor the Dots project, but I recognize that I need more foundations first. Before tackling a serious refactoring, I need to:
- Conduct thorough performance analysis
- Implement comprehensive tracing
- Break down the code to optimize data types and algorithms
- Apply systems thinking to the architecture

It's still too early in my journey to dive into this level of refactoring, but the groundwork is being laid with every new concept I master.

## üéØ Objectives for the Next Month:

1. **Exercism**: Start moving faster through the exercises now that I have a solid foundation
2. **Missing Semester**: Complete the remaining courses, do the homework, and internalize the concepts
3. **SICP**: Continue with Chapter 2 and apply the concepts to small projects
4. **Mathematics**: Finish the high school curriculum and begin more CS-specific math topics
5. **Typing**: Push beyond 80 WPM consistently and master all keys, especially the troublesome "S"

That's the checkpoint for Week 5. The journey continues with deeper understanding and sharper skills.

See you at the next checkpoint.
