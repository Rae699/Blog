# Week 5 - Bilan

Time for the second checkpoint. Let's see where we stand.

## ‚úÖ Achievements:

### Exercism Progress
While the raw numbers might not look impressive, I've been spending a couple of hours daily to truly internalize the syntax of the 17 lessons completed so far. This deeper approach is paying dividends‚ÄîI'm feeling significantly more confident when writing code now.

Rather than rushing through exercises and forgetting half of what I learned, I've been meticulously reviewing each solution, understanding the Python idioms, and making sure the syntax becomes second nature. It's slow progress in terms of exercise count, but the quality of understanding has increased dramatically.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Typing Speed
Great progress here! I'm consistently hitting over 80 words per minute and unlocking letters step by step. The "S" key has been giving me trouble‚Äîmy left hand on the home row seems to have difficulty positioning the right finger precisely over the S key.

Here are some highlights from my typing journey:

As you can see, I've completed 710 lessons with an average speed of 82.8 WPM and a top speed of 113.8 WPM. My accuracy is consistently high at 94.5%.

I'm particularly proud of my accuracy streaks:

The performance distribution is also interesting - my typing speed puts me in the top 10% of users:

I've been tracking my progress for individual keys as well:

The learning progress overview shows how consistent I've been with practicing regularly:

My top speed evolution shows significant improvement over time, peaking at 142.2 WPM:

### üìö SICP Deep Dive
Check my other posts for the full details, but I've finished Chapter 1 and I'm well into Chapter 2 now. The mental shift has been profound‚ÄîI've stopped thinking about programming in terms of "how to write that" and started thinking in terms of "how to build that efficiently."

I'm now considering how to:
- Optimize data types and structures
- Think about edge cases for recursion
- Integrate memory considerations and Big O thinking into my solutions

The frameworks provided by SICP are reshaping my entire approach to problem-solving in programming.

### üßÆ Big Push in Mathematics
I've taken another deep dive into mathematics, covering everything from secondary school material up through the advanced high school math specialty curriculum. I'm making strong progress and will continue for another month to ensure everything is well integrated.

Thanks to my previous work on CFA Level 1 and parts of Level 2 (covering quantitative methods, economics, and ethics‚Äî3 out of 10 chapters), I'm actually quite comfortable with probability theory already.

### üñ•Ô∏è Missing Semester
Slow but steady progress here. I'm definitely more comfortable with the shell, but need to fully internalize the concepts and commands. This is an area where repeated practice is essential.

## üìª Dots & Sentinelle Updates

I'm beginning to think about how to refactor the Dots project, but I recognize that I need more foundations first. Before tackling a serious refactoring, I need to:
- Conduct thorough performance analysis
- Implement comprehensive tracing
- Break down the code to optimize data types and algorithms
- Apply systems thinking to the architecture

It's still too early in my journey to dive into this level of refactoring, but the groundwork is being laid with every new concept I master.

## üéØ Objectives for the Next Month:

1. **Exercism**: Start moving faster through the exercises now that I have a solid foundation
2. **Missing Semester**: Complete the remaining courses, do the homework, and internalize the concepts
3. **SICP**: Continue with Chapter 2 and apply the concepts to small projects
4. **Mathematics**: Finish the high school curriculum and begin more CS-specific math topics
5. **Typing**: Push beyond 80 WPM consistently and master all keys, especially the troublesome "S"

That's the checkpoint for Week 5. The journey continues with deeper understanding and sharper skills.

See you at the next checkpoint.
