## 🛠️ The Plan: 24 Months to Mastery

Welcome! This repository documents my journey from total beginner to mastering computer science, algorithms, and AI-driven trading systems.  
Over the next **24 months**, I'll be following a structured plan combining classic CS education, daily practice, and real-world projects.

This journey is meticulously planned to ensure a structured and comprehensive path to mastery. 
It's a personal roadmap designed to keep me organized and focused on my goals.

*“This 24-month plan is designed to not only master core CS and AI but to meet the bar of systems design and algorithmic excellence required to operate at the scale of companies like Google.”*

## 📚 Core CS Curriculum
- **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)**: Focuses on programming paradigms, recursion, and functional programming.
- **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective (CS:APP)**: Delves into low-level programming, memory, assembly, and linking.
- **The Algorithm Design Manual (Skiena)**: Concentrates on algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.
- **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)**: Covers memory, scheduling, concurrency, processes, and virtual memory.
- **Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach**: Discusses TCP/IP, HTTP, routing, security, and distributed networking.
- **Thinking in Systems (Meadows)**: Provides insights into big-picture system design and architecture.
- **Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDIA)**: Explores distributed data, scalability, and real-time computing.
- **Reading in Database**: Focuses on database internals, including indexes, transactions, and query optimization.
- **Efficient Python**: 1 lesson per day, for 90 days. 
- **C Programming: A Modern Approach**: Emphasizes low-level memory management, pointers, and system programming.
- **Cloud Architecture Patterns**: Examines distributed AI applications and scalable systems.
-	**Introduction to the Theory of Computation**: Only Ch. 1-6, light Ch. 7-9: Covers automata & complexity for deeper CS knowledge.
-	**Computational Complexity**: Only Part I & II.


## 🤖 AI Track (For Advanced Trading Systems)
Once the core systems are solid:
- **Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Russell & Norvig)**
- **Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Bishop)**
- **Deep Learning (Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville)**
- **+ One of these for hands-on practice:**
  - Hands-On Machine Learning (Géron)
  - Deep Learning with Python (Chollet)
  - Deep Learning for Coders (Howard & Gugger)

## 🏗️ Daily Routine (The Dots Discipline)
Every day, without compromise, i will mix some of these to grind hard:
- ⌨️ **Typing Practice** — 15 min (Goal: >120 WPM)
- 🐍 **Exercism (Python)** — 90 min (Goal: 5+ exercises per week until lessons are completed, then 2+ exercises per day for a total of ~10 per week. Should take 4 months ~ish). Followed by reading Efficient Python (one item per day for 90 days.  Should take 4 months ~ish), and High Performance Python (±10 pages per day. Should take ~2.5 months). Expected total: ~11 months.  
- 📖 **CS Readings** — 240 min (from the curriculum above)
- 🛠️ **The Missing Semester** — Complete 1 lesson per day. Once finished, allocate the freed-up time to additional Exercism/Python reading/LeetCode practice.
- 🧠 **LeetCode, NeetCode** — algorithmic drills
- 📊 **Dots Trading System** — ongoing development & refactoring

The mission: **become the Cyborg**, where human intuition and AI co-evolve through disciplined systems thinking, coding fluency, and algorithmic sharpness.

## 🚧 Current Projects


### [Dots](https://github.com/Rae699/Dots)

A modular trading suite for signal generation and strategy automation. From scratch.

**In progress:**
- Finalize 5 core screeners.
- Debug with VizTracer.
- Refactor RSI divergence and trendline logic.
- Add:
  - ADXponential module.
  - BreakSi module.
- Full code optimization using new DSA knowledge.


### [Sentinelle](https://github.com/SentiCap/SentinelleCap)

A collaborative trading infrastructure with modular, plug-and-play strategies.


---

## 🎯 Meta Goals

- ✅ Build open-source projects (for the portfolio and community).
- ✅ Write blog posts and developer logs.
- ✅ Share progress openly (accountability + proof of work).
- ✅ Commit to 8-hour deep work days.
- ✅ Track wins, blockers, breakthroughs.

## 📌 Why This Exists

### To become the kind of engineer Google hires:
A systems-minded, algorithmically sharp, AI-enabled builder who can design, optimize, and deploy robust, high-performance infrastructure.

### To close the gap between:
- **"I can hack it together."**  
and  
- **"I can build it properly."**

And to document the entire journey from beginner to builder to architect.  

Follow along, fork the repo, or reach out. 

Let's build.
