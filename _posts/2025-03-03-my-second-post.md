# 🛠️ The Plan: 24 Months to Mastery

Welcome! This repository documents my journey from total beginner to mastering computer science, algorithms, and AI-driven trading systems.  
Over the next **24 months**, I'll be following a structured plan combining classic CS education, daily practice, and real-world projects.

This journey is meticulously planned to ensure a structured and comprehensive path to mastery. It's a personal roadmap designed to keep me organized and focused on my goals.

## ⏳ Timeline — 24-Month Roadmap

| Timeframe | Focus |
|-----------|-------|
| **Months 1–3** | Python, Exercism, Basic DSA: arrays/strings/hashmaps. Start LeetCode. |
| **Months 4–6** | Recursion, binary search, trees. Refactor my main project |
| **Months 7–9** | Sorting, sliding window, two pointers, basic graphs. |
| **Months 10–12** | Dynamic Programming intro, heaps, tries. Deliver 1 larger project (full stack using ai?) |
| **Months 13–15** | Advanced graphs (Dijkstra, BFS/DFS patterns). LeetCode mediums+. |
| **Months 16–18** | DP mastery, backtracking, bit manipulation. |
| **Months 19–21** | System design, distributed systems intro. Leetcode Hard+.|
| **Months 22–24** |Final project delivery. Enjoy life changing skills |

## 📚 Core CS Curriculum

I'm following a **"classics-first"** approach, built around these foundational texts:

- **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)**
- **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective (CS:APP)**
- **The Algorithm Design Manual** (Skiena)
- **Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDIA)**
- **Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach**
- **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)**
- **C Programming: A Modern Approach**
- **Fluent Python**

---

## 🤖 AI Track (For Advanced Trading Systems)

In parallel, I'll tackle AI and machine learning to build adaptive, intelligent trading systems:

- **Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach** (Russell & Norvig)
- **Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning** (Bishop)
- **Deep Learning** (Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville)
- **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow** (Géron)
- **Deep Learning with Python** (Chollet)
- **Deep Learning for Coders with fastai & PyTorch** (Howard & Gugger)

## 🏗️ Daily Routine (The Dots Discipline)

Every day, without fail:

- ⌨️ Typing practice — 20 min (Goal: > 120 WPM)
- 🐍 Exercism (Python) — 90 min (Goal: >30 exercises per week)
- 📖 CS Readings — 180 min
- 🛠️ The Missing Semester of your CS education — 1 lesson/day
- ⚡ Bash & CLI scripting — post-Missing Semester (Goal: Be fluent using cli)
- 🧠 LeetCode, NeetCode, 
- 📊 DOTS Trading system development & refactoring

## ⚙️ Current Projects

### [Dots](https://github.com/Rae699/Dots)
A modular trading suite for signal generation and strategy automation. From scratch.

**In progress:**
- Finalize 5 core screeners.
- Debug with VizTracer.
- Refactor RSI divergence and trendline logic.
- Add:
  - ADXponential module.
  - BreakSi module.
- Full code optimization using new DSA knowledge.

---

### [Sentinelle](https://github.com/SentiCap/SentinelleCap)
A collaborative trading infrastructure with modular, plug-and-play strategies.

---

## 🎯 Meta Goals

- ✅ Build open-source projects (for the portfolio and community).
- ✅ Write blog posts and developer logs.
- ✅ Share progress openly (accountability + proof of work).
- ✅ Commit to 8-hour deep work days.
- ✅ Track wins, blockers, breakthroughs.

---

## 📌 Why This Exists

To close the gap between:
- **"I can hack it together."**  
and  
- **"I can build it properly."**

And to document the entire journey from beginner to builder to architect.  

Follow along, fork the repo, or reach out. 

Let's build.
