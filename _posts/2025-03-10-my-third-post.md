# Week 1 - Bilan

Alright, time to log the first checkpoint.


## ‚úÖ Achievements:

### ~20 exercises completed on Exercism.  
Honestly, that's a cool milestone. I can feel the muscle growing. 
But here's the truth: the code still doesn't quite feel like mine. I'm getting the jobs done, but there are these silly mistakes sneaking in‚Äîtiny syntax slips, misplaced colons, off-by-one things that shouldn't really happen. 
It's like I'm holding the steering wheel but still checking the GPS every five seconds.

The dictionary exercises were a real challenge and left me feeling pretty down.
Everything felt like a giant fog and was like "Ok... what methods should i call, i actually almost dont know any"

That said, the progress is real.  

A couple of months ago? I'd stare at a problem and just go blank. "_What even is this asking me to do?"_  

Now I can at least map the territory. I read the problem, and I kind of know what's expected. I can picture the flow, sketch a rough solution.  
The gap now is just turning that into clean, error-free Python without stumbling on the basics.
Hence the need to internalize methods, cold.

I need to get a solid grasp on the built-in functions and methods for python, nail down the syntax and methods so I'm not lost in the fog.

New method and goal set:
- Master the documentation of the exercises I have completed.
- Thoroughly read and internalize the documentation of upcoming exercises.
- Only after becoming familiar with the documentation, attempt to solve the related exercises. This approach should be more enjoyable and build confidence, not disappointment.
- Complete 2 exercises per day until reaching 50, then reduce to 1 exercise per day. This way, I'll finish Exercism in approximately three and a half months.


### Missing semester of your CS? 
I was doing quite well until I encountered RegEx, Vim, and CLI.
The sheer volume of information presented was overwhelming.
I felt inundated. 

Here's the deal: RegEx? Let AI handle that for now. 
VIM? Not quite there yet.
CLI? Love it, but tools like sed, awk, and tmux will get mastered over time with consistent use.

New goal set:
- Internalize some of these commands cold,
- Work again on the solutions of these videos, internalize them.

## üîú SICP

Make a separate chapter no?! 

Firsts feelings are absolute fire.
This is the exact "philosophy of programming" i was looking fo.

After 40 pages, you already understand how substitution model works from a computer perspective.
2 evaluations methodes, applicative-oirder/hnoirmal-order

Interperter usually go for applicative, which can get stuck if the variables cant reach a point where they all are primnitives datas.

And i probably finally unlock some understanding of recusion, especially with the comparison of recusrive versus iterative, 
One leading to deferred operations and explosive growth for time
THe other being way leaner.

Inser ackerman 2 asset?!

## üîú What's next?

Pretty clear to me:
1. **Own the syntax.** Really own it. Get to the point where I type it without thinking.
2. After that, it's time to **level up on the Python "tools"** ‚Äî all those standard library tricks, those built-ins, the stuff that lets you glide through problems.

The good news? I already brute-forced my way through a ton of that while vibe-coding the [dots screeners](https://github.com/Rae699/Dots)  

So once the fundamentals click, I know there's this whole toolkit waiting to be sharpened and used properly.

## - Dots + Sentinelle Updates

The vibe-coding journey continues, and while the critical thinking piece is still a work in progress, the learning curve is exhilarating. 
With AI as my co-pilot, it's like having a seasoned dev' whispering insights in my ear all day long.

The real magic will happen once the syntax and fundamentals are second nature. Here's what I've tackled so far for the Dots and Sentinelle:
- Implemented tracing to map out the path for refactoring and eliminating redundancies.
- Fixed one of the five screeners that was completely off-track, all thanks to the tracing.
- Translated sentinelle's strategies into Python and pushed them to GitHub.
- Worked on resolving the pnl_tracking issues in Sentinelle's pkl.

All of this, powered by AI.

The real game-changer? Critical thinking. 
As knowledge becomes more accessible, the ability to think critically and make decisions will be the new frontier.
This is the path forward.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Typing Speed

**80 WPM achieved.**  
For a few letters only.

It matters because time spent typing isn't the problem ‚Äî time spent _thinking_ is.  
But hey, when the ideas are flowing, might as well have the hands to match.

Next step: Adding more letters at 80 WPM, then aiming for 120 WPM.

## üìö Elsewhere on the grind:

**SICP** ‚Äì Currently, page 75
Working through the exercises.  

And yeah... I won't lie, Lisp is not my favorite flavor.  
Would 100% prefer this in Python. But the thinking it forces? Gold.  
There's a level of reasoning in there that's making me way sharper, even if the syntax feels like wearing someone else's shoes.

**Missing Semester** ‚Äì Knocked out 4 lessons.  
Terminal, git, bash, vim... All the little things that will make me dangerous in a shell.  
These are the tools that remove friction from everything else. 
No complaints. 

Enjoying the journey.

That's it for Week 1.  
Next week? Fewer silly mistakes, faster syntax recall, and making this stuff feel like second nature.

See you in the next checkpoint.
