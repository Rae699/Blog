# Trading Through the Storm: Market Analysis & My Edge
<br>

While I'm deep in my CS journey, I'm also actively trading to fund this transition.  
Balancing both has been intense, but the truth is: these markets demand it.  
Today, I want to share my current read on the macro landscape and how I'm positioning myself to stay sharp—both as a trader and a builder.

<br>

<br>
## The Big Picture: Economic Headwinds
<br>

As [Mark Minervini highlighted](https://x.com/markminervini/status/1896580468729938316), the S&P 500 cycle composite suggests continued weakness into early April, followed by a potential rally into the summer.  
The long-term trend remains intact for now—our $SPY Advisor Model hasn't flipped bearish—but cracks are forming.  

Personally, I see the early signs of a speculative bubble. Of course, bubbles can drag on longer than anyone expects... but they never end quietly.
Everyone thinks markets only go up, it almost feels like there is no more fear of losing money in the markets.

</div>
<br>

Right now, the S&P 500 is trading above its upper trend channel.  
Historically? That only happened in 1929, 2000, and briefly in 2021. 

None of those ended well.  

In my opinion, a correction here wouldn't just be expected—it'd be healthy. 
Blow off some steam, reset expectations, and potentially set up the next leg higher with a stronger foundation.

<h3>Steve Cohen on Current Risks</h3>
<p>From his recent [Yahoo Finance interview](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-fund-boss-steve-cohen-114734444.html):</p>
<blockquote>
_"I think this is one of those moments where there's really a lot of uncertainty... Tariffs cannot be positive, I mean it's a tax. And you can imagine tit for tat if the U.S. does something—it implements a tax on somebody—somebody else is going to perhaps raise the stakes and raise their tax back."_
</blockquote>
</div>
<br>

**Key risks I'm tracking:**  
- Tariffs and potential trade wars  
- Slowing immigration tightening the labor market  
- Fiscal austerity colliding with election-year spending  
- Point72's GDP outlook: a sharp drop from 2.5% to 1.5%  

<br>

<br>
## Why This Matters
<br>

A 40% slowdown in GDP growth, especially compressed into a single quarter, isn't just a number on a chart.  

**Historically, that kind of sudden deceleration signaled major turning points—think 1987, 2000, 2008.**  

The speed matters. Markets can digest gradual slowdowns. They choke on sudden stops.  
And right now, valuations aren't reflecting that risk. I'm personally not betting on this ending softly.

<br>

<br>
## The Dollar Devaluation Thesis
<br>

This isn't theoretical.  
As Howard Marks wrote in his latest [Oaktree memo, *On Bubble Watch*](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/memo-podcast/behind-the-memo-on-bubble-watch):

<br>
> _"It shouldn't come as a surprise that the return on an investment is significantly a function of the price paid for it. For that reason, investors clearly shouldn't be indifferent to today's market valuation."_

Put simply: the risk/reward here is getting skewed.

Where do we go from here? Here's the scenario I'm preparing for:

1. Bear market phase 
2. Aggressive dollar devaluation to manage debt 
3. Rotation into hard assets (commodities, gold, Bitcoin)  

<br>

<br>
## How I'm Positioned
<br>

I'm not trying to predict the exact top. I'm not calling the crash.  
I'm just listening to what the market is telling me and adapting.

Here's my current stance:  
- **Almost zero long exposure**  
- **High cash levels** for opportunities

It's a defensive posture. I'd rather protect capital than chase gains in a late-stage move.  
Risk management over hero trades, always.

<br>

<br>
## My Edge Right Now
<br>

1. **Technology**: I'm building better tools than I've ever had.  
2. **Systematic Process**: No room for emotions—just execution.  
3. **Dual Focus**: CS and trading feeding each other, compounding skill.  

<br>

<br>
## Why This Fuels My CS Journey
<br>

This market is part of why I'm pouring so much energy into CS.  
It's not just about surviving the storm—it's about building systems that *thrive* in it.

1. I'm building robust trading systems.  
2. I'm grinding core CS concepts daily.  
3. I'm exploring AI/ML to scale decision-making.  

The long-term vision? Fully automated, adaptive strategies that allow me to focus on deep work—while my systems handle the rest.

<br>

<br>
## What's Next
<br>

The next 6-12 months feel like a crossroads.  

Markets don't care about opinions.  
They care about flows, positioning, and psychology.  

While I'm working through SICP and grinding LeetCode, I'm also monitoring:

- Dollar strength trends (DXY and major forex pairs)
- Hard asset price action (gold + BTC)
- Market structure shifts (slowly ongoing)
- Systemic risk markers
- Retail sentiment (no fear, "up only")
