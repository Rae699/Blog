# Trading Through the Storm: Market Analysis & My Edge

While I'm deep in my CS journey, I'm also actively trading to fund this transition. Today, I want to share some thoughts on the current market landscape and how I'm positioning myself.

<br>

## The Big Picture: Economic Headwinds

The S&P 500 cycle composite work suggests continued weakness heading into early April before a potential rally into the Summer. While our long-term trend remains intact and the $SPY Advisor Model hasn't triggered a sell signal yet, there are concerning signs of potential bubble formation - though bubbles can take considerable time to pop.

<br>

Notably, the S&P 500 is trading above its upper trend channel. This has only occurred a few times historically - around the 1929 and 2000 peaks, with a brief excursion during the 2021 peak. A correction at this point could actually be healthy, letting some air out of the market to fuel a more sustainable bull market.

<h3>Steve Cohen on Current Risks</h3>
<p>"I think this is one of those moments where there's really a lot of uncertainty... Tariffs cannot be positive, I mean it's a tax. And you can imagine tit for tat if the U.S. does somethingâ€”it implements a tax on somebodyâ€”somebody else is going to perhaps raise the stakes and raise their tax back."</p>
</div>

Key concerns from Cohen's analysis:
- Tariff impacts and potential trade wars
- Slowing immigration affecting labor force growth
- DOGE-related austerity measures
- Point72's outlook: Economic growth dropping from 2.5% to 1.5%

## The Dollar Devaluation Thesis

Here's where it gets interesting. The setup looks increasingly like we're heading toward:

1. A bear market phase
2. Followed by significant dollar devaluation to address debt
3. Creating a massive opportunity in hard assets

<br>

As Howard Marks notes:
> "It shouldn't come as a surprise that the return on an investment is significantly a function of the price paid for it. For that reason, investors clearly shouldn't be indifferent to today's market valuation."

<br>

### My Positioning Strategy

Given these signals, I've adjusted my positioning:
- Almost zero long exposure
- Maintaining $SPY short position (initiated 2/24)
- Using shorts as hedge against remaining long positions

<br>

<div class="warning-box">
<p>Key Risk: As Marks warns, "the multiple correction is compressed into a year or two, implying a big decline in stock prices such as we saw in 1973-74 and 2000-02."</p>
</div>

## Why This Matters for My CS Journey

This market environment is exactly why I'm:

1. Building robust trading systems
2. Learning CS fundamentals deeply
3. Focusing on AI/ML for better market analysis

<br>

The goal isn't just to trade betterâ€”it's to build systems that can adapt to changing market conditions while I focus on my CS studies.

<br>

## Looking Ahead

The next 6-12 months could be pivotal. While I'm grinding LeetCode and studying SICP, I'm keeping a close eye on:

<div class="analysis-section">
<h3>Key Indicators</h3>
- Dollar strength indicators
- Hard asset valuations
- Technical market structure
- Systematic risk signals

<br>

## My Edge in This Market

1. **Technology**: Building better tools than I've ever had
2. **Systematic Approach**: Removing emotion from execution
3. **Dual Focus**: Using CS skills to enhance trading, using trading to fund CS studies

<br>

Remember what Howard Marks emphasizes: Markets don't care about our opinions. They care about supply and demand, flows, and positioning. Stay systematic, stay humble.
