# 👋 Welcome to My Engineering Journey

Hi, I'm Remy. I'm on an intense 2-year journey to transform from a real estate lawyer into a Google-level software engineer, studying 50+ hours per week. This blog documents my entire journey—the wins, the struggles, and everything I learn along the way.

## 🎯 The Goal

**Transform into a world-class software engineer capable of building complex, scalable systems.**

My north star? Getting into Google. Not just passing the interview, but being able to genuinely contribute at that level.
