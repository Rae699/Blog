## Week 1 — From Zero to CS  

Not long ago, I was a **real estate lawyer**. Safe, predictable, linear. Then crypto happened. Then trading. And now... this.  

I'm starting from scratch. (Again) 

Sure, I've been trading crypto for years, but when it comes to real computer science? I'm a total beginner. 

Coding? No, vibe-coding.
Python? Barely holding-on without AI assistance.

I'm working through the early tracks on Exercism, realizing how much I don't know, and honestly… it's humbling.  

I've made the decision: I want to build real things. I want to stop being just "technical enough" to scrape by. I want to close the gap between someone hacking scripts together and someone who truly *understands* the systems they're building on.  

And the only way is through.

### How It Started  

Everything kicked off with my trading system automation.  

In December 2024, I cobbled together my first big set of scripts—a messy, 2,500-line vibe-coded monster that somehow… worked. It was my first attempt at building **screeners** and automating parts of my strategy. And when it ran, seeing the signals come through, watching the system process the data... I felt that spark. 

Real satisfaction.  

You can check out a glimpse of that work on my [Dots GitHub](https://github.com/Rae699/Dots) (though some parts or the whole repo might stay private—black box strategies and all).  

But as soon as I finished, I knew duct tape wasn't enough.  

I needed structure.  

If I really wanted to scale it—plug in new strategies, add exchange integrations, build robust pipelines, or even merge it with **Sentinelle**, my side project with Jun, Sylvain, and Emile—I couldn't keep piling features on top of spaghetti code.  

That's when I realized:  
- I needed to learn how to build proper systems.  
- I needed Computer Science.

### Where I Am  

Right now?  
- Learning Python basics through **Exercism**.  
- Struggling, in the best way.  
- Slowly getting comfortable with problems that once felt impossible.  

I'm not here to fake expertise. I'm here to document the real thing: the messy, slow climb from beginner to builder.

### Where I'm Going  

I'm taking a **"classics first"** approach, knowing it might take years—but also knowing these are the foundations that last:  

- **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)**  
  _(because it seems everyone I respect has read it twice)_  

- **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective (CS:APP)**  
  _(to finally understand what's happening under the hood)_  

- **The Algorithm Design Manual**  
  _(so I can start Leetcode!)_  

- **Designing Data-Intensive Applications**  
  _(for scalable, reliable architectures)_  

- **Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach**  

- **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces**  

- **C Programming: A Modern Approach**  
  _(because Python without understanding C is like playing jazz without scales)_

- **Fluent Python**  
  _(to finally feel at home in the language)_  

And after that? More **LeetCode**, and a path to AI with **ML books**, and my **own projects** to lock it all in.  

For AI? Andrew NG courses,

### My Ultimate Goal: AI-Powered Trading

Beyond the CS foundations, I have a clear endgame: building a complete automated trading system powered by advanced AI. Not just scripts, but a sophisticated system that can:

- Implement my trading strategies with precision
- Optimize execution using Machine Learning
- Adapt to market conditions through Reinforcement Learning
- Identify patterns using Deep Learning

To get there, I'm adding these foundational AI texts to my reading list:

1. **Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach** (Russell & Norvig)  
   _(The AI bible—covering everything from search algorithms to reinforcement learning)_

2. **Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning** (Bishop)  
   _(For the mathematical foundations of ML—probability, statistics, and core algorithms)_

3. **Deep Learning** (Goodfellow, Bengio & Courville)  
   _(The comprehensive guide to neural networks and modern deep learning)_

But theory isn't enough. I'm pairing these with practical resources:

- **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow** (Géron)  
  _(To start building real models)_

- **Deep Learning with Python** (Chollet)  
  _(For mastering Keras/TensorFlow implementation)_

- **Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai & PyTorch** (Howard & Gugger)  
  _(Alternative PyTorch path if needed)_

The goal isn't just to understand these tools—it's to apply them effectively to trading. I want to build systems that can:
- Detect market regimes based on my already coded strategies
- Optimize entry/exit points using ML/RL
- Manage risk dynamically
- Identify complex patterns across multiple timeframes

It's ambitious. Maybe too ambitious. 
But that's the point.

### Now Working On  

- [Dots](https://github.com/your-dots-repo) — signal screeners, trading tools (some parts may remain private for obvious reasons, these are proven working strategies).  
=> My current goal is to finalize the 5 screeners, then start tracing the code properly. Remove redundancies. Then, start refactoring with proper optimization once i have sufficient DSA knowledge.
- [Sentinelle](https://github.com/SentiCap/SentinelleCap) — a collaborative trading infrastructure project with Jun, Sylvain, and Emile, all investment-bankers.

### How I'm Getting There  

- **8 hours every day**, no matter what.  
- Exercism, LeetCode, reading, coding for my own projects?
- Tracking everything. Wins, failures, breakthroughs.  
- Staying patient. 

This isn't a bootcamp. This is my new normal.

This blog is how I'll keep myself accountable.  

And maybe one day, I'll look back at this first post and barely recognize the person who wrote it.  

For now, I'm just getting started.
