# About Me

Hi, I am Remy.

Not long ago, I was a real estate lawyer. Safe, predictable, linear.  
Then crypto happened. I started trading heavily and successfully. Not linear, emotional rollercoaster.  
I took CFA lvl 1 exam, passed on first attempt.  

And now‚Ä¶ I'm beginning anew (Once more!)  

Diving headfirst into Computer Science with a single, clear objective: **To excel in programming and create amazing things.**

## Why?
AI will set a baseline for coding skills, making **critical thinking** and **mastery of fundamentals** the key differentiators.

This blog is where I document the journey ‚Äî from zero to creating powerful, AI-driven trading systems, tools and more.

## What I'm focused on:
- **Computer Science fundamentals** (the real stuff)
- **Python programming** (and leveling up fast)
- **Data Structures & Algorithms** (because speed matters)
- **Machine Learning & AI** (for smarter systems)
- **Creative coding projects** (because why not?)

## Projects I'm building:
- [**Dots**](https://github.com/Rae699/Dots) ‚Äî a rock-solid trading system foundation for signals detection, trading execution. 
- [**Sentinelle**](https://github.com/SentiCap/SentinelleCap) ‚Äî AI-powered market analysis and signal generation  

Next steps:
- CS Mastery
- Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Reinforcement learning to automate my systems and increase perf'

## Let's Connect
I'm always open to discussing technology, trading strategies, or potential collaborations. You can find me on:
