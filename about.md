# About Me

I used to be a real estate lawyer. Then I went full-time into trading. Now, I'm going all-in on Computer Science with one clear goal:  
**become a beast at programming and build wonderful things.**

This blog is where I document the journey â€” from zero to creating powerful, AI-driven trading systems and tools.

### What I'm focused on:
- **Computer Science fundamentals** (the real stuff)
- **Python programming** (and leveling up fast)
- **Data Structures & Algorithms** (because speed matters)
- **Machine Learning & AI** (for smarter systems)
- **Creative coding projects** (because why not?)

### Projects I'm building:
- **Dots** â€” a rock-solid trading system foundation  
- **Sentinelle** â€” AI-powered market analysis and signal generation  

For context, I hold a Juris Doctor, and passed CFA level 1 on first attempt, almost 90th percentile.
Law and finance are covered.
Now it's time to master CS & code.
