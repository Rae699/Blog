# About Me
Hi,

I am Remy.

Not long ago, I was a real estate lawyer. Safe, predictable, linear. 
Then crypto happened. I started trading heavily and successfully. Not linear, emotional rollercoaster. 
And now…
I’m beginning anew (Once more!)
Diving headfirst into Computer Science with a single, clear objective: **To excel in programming and create amazing things.**

AI will set a baseline for coding skills, making critical thinking and mastery of fundamentals the key differentiators.

This blog is where I document the journey — from zero to creating powerful, AI-driven trading systems, tools and more.

### What I'm focused on:
- **Computer Science fundamentals** (the real stuff)
- **Python programming** (and leveling up fast)
- **Data Structures & Algorithms** (because speed matters)
- **Machine Learning & AI** (for smarter systems)
- **Creative coding projects** (because why not?)

### Projects I'm building:
- **Dots** — a rock-solid trading system foundation for signals detection, trading execution. 
- **Sentinelle** — AI-powered market analysis and signal generation  
Next steps =
- CS Mastery
- Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Reinforcement learning to automate my systems and increase perf'

For context, I hold a Juris Doctor, and passed CFA level 1 on first attempt, almost 90th percentile.
Law and finance are covered.
Now it's time to master CS & code.
