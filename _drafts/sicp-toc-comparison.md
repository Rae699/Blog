## How to Use These Posts

1. **Start with the Key Takeaways post** if you're new to SICP or want a high-level understanding of its core concepts. This post provides accessible explanations with clear examples.

2. **Dive into the Summary post** when you want deeper technical explanations and implementation details. This post explores advanced topics like normal-order evaluation, constraint systems, and the mathematical foundations.

3. **Reference both posts** when working through SICP exercises. The Key Takeaways post provides conceptual understanding, while the Summary post offers technical details to help with implementation.

The blog posts are designed to complement each other, with the Key Takeaways offering breadth and the Summary providing depth.
