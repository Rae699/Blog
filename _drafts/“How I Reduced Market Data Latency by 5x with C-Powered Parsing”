Where to Implement C for Maximum Impact in Dots

Google would love C optimizations, but only where they make a real, measurable impact—especially in performance-critical areas. Since Dots involves data ingestion, signal computation, and screening, the best places to introduce C (or Cython/Rust) are:

⸻

🔥 1. Optimizing Signal Computation (Most Impactful)

Why?
	•	Currently: Python is fast to write but slow at numerical computation.
	•	Bottleneck: If your trading strategy logic is iterating over large datasets, Python’s GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) slows it down.
	•	Fix: Move core computations (e.g., feature engineering, indicators, statistical calculations) to C.

How?
	•	Use Cython to optimize core trading logic while keeping Python’s flexibility.
	•	If extreme speed is needed, write C extensions for vectorized calculations.

✅ Example Functions to Optimize in C:
	•	Indicator calculations (EMA, RSI, VWAP, Bollinger Bands).
	•	Portfolio allocation & risk-adjusted return computations.
	•	Any loop-heavy operations involving NumPy/Pandas.

📌 Google will love it because:
	•	It shows low-level performance thinking—a core SWE skill.
	•	You prove you understand CPU/memory optimizations beyond just writing Python.
	•	You profile before & after, proving real performance gains.

✅ Blog Post Title Idea:

	•	Show before/after benchmarks 📊.
	•	Explain why Python was slow and how C fixed it.
	•	Discuss trade-offs & maintainability.

🚀 2. Speeding Up Market Data Ingestion (If Latency is an Issue)

Why?
	•	If Dots pulls huge datasets from Binance, Python’s I/O overhead can slow things down.
	•	Bottleneck: Parsing and structuring large JSON/CSV data.
	•	Fix: Use a C-based parser instead of native Python.

How?
	•	Replace slow Python JSON parsing (json.loads()) with ultra-fast C libraries like:
	•	simdjson (C++ but Python wrapper available).
	•	ujson (written in C, faster than Python’s default).
	•	For high-frequency trading, consider writing a lightweight C socket client.

📌 Google will love it because:
	•	You show systems-level thinking—optimizing low-level I/O.
	•	Real-world impact: Faster ingestion = fresher trading signals.
	•	It shows you understand API bottlenecks and latency reduction.

⚡ 3. Parallelizing Execution (Avoiding Python’s GIL)

Why?
	•	Python struggles with parallelism due to the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock).
	•	Bottleneck: If you process many signals concurrently, Python threads won’t help much.
	•	Fix: Use Cython/OpenMP for true parallel execution.

How?
	•	Convert Python loops into C-level parallelized operations.
	•	Use OpenMP for multi-threaded computation.

📌 Google will love it because:
	•	You demonstrate multi-threading knowledge beyond basic Python.
	•	You optimize beyond algorithmic efficiency—into real execution speed.
	•	Your code is designed for scalability.

🛠️ Should You Use C or Rust?

If you want to impress Google engineers, Rust is also a great choice because:
	•	It’s safer than C (no memory leaks).
	•	It’s being adopted at Google (e.g., Chrome team).
	•	It has Python bindings via pyo3 for smooth integration.

If raw performance & compatibility with Python is key, Cython or C extensions are best.

⸻

🔥 Final Takeaway:
	1.	Optimize where it matters—profile first, then rewrite in C where Python is slow.
	2.	Make a compelling blog post showing before/after results.
	3.	Position yourself as an engineer, not a scripter—showing low-level performance tuning is a great L4 skill.
