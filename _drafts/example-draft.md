# Draft Post Example

This post won't appear on your site until you:
1. Move it to the `_posts` directory
2. Add a date to the filename
3. Set `published: true` in the front matter

## Benefits of Draft Posts

1. Work on posts without publishing them
2. Preview locally with `jekyll serve --drafts`
3. Keep your working drafts separate from published content
4. No date required in filename while in drafts
