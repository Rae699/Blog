#  Welcome to My Engineering Journey

Hi👋

I'm Remy. 

I'm on an intense 2-year journey to transform from a real estate lawyer turned portfolio manager in a family-office into a FAANG-level software engineer, studying 50+ hours per week. 
This blog documents my entire journey—the wins, the struggles, and everything I learn along the way.

Why? 

I have been vibe-coding with ai my entire trading strategies and i have now reached the point where i need CS skills to optimize it more.

## 🎯 The Goal

**Transform into a world-class software engineer capable of building complex, scalable and reliable systems.**

My north star? Getting into a FAANG. 

Not just passing the interview, but **being able to genuinely contribute at that level.**

## 🧠 Learning Stack

The goal is to master algorithms and push massively on systems, as the future is Cyborg, humans accelerated by AI, not full-AI imho.

### 📚 Core CS
1. [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url "2025-03-09-SICP#1" %})
2. Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective
3. The Algorithm Design Manual
4. Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach
5. Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)
6. Thinking in Systems
7. Cloud architecture patterns*
8. Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDIA)
9. C Programming: A Modern Approach** 
[Full Reading List]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2025-03-03-my-second-post %})
<br>

### 🤖 AI Track (For Advanced Trading Systems)

After having built strong fondations, I'll tackle AI and machine learning to build adaptive, intelligent trading systems:
- **Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach** (Russell & Norvig)
- **Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning** (Bishop)
- **Deep Learning** (Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville)
One of these:
- **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow** (Géron)
- **Deep Learning with Python** (Chollet)
- **Deep Learning for Coders with fastai & PyTorch** (Howard & Gugger)

### Phase 2: Advanced Concepts
- 🔄 Systems (thinking, design, cloud, data-intensive)
- 🔲 Advanced Algorithms
- 🔲 Distributed Systems
- 🔲 AI optimization (i have a ton of structured and unstructured from my 10y trading journey)
- 🔲 [Full Roadmap Here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2025-03-03-my-second-post %})
